        <li> Soulless is an atmospheric 2D puzzle platformer set in a world of silhouettes. 
You play as a cute creature called Elin whose main goal is to save his friend, but to do that he has to jump down the rabbit hole into a magical world which is unknown to him.
He is guided through the world by a light, that shines with hope, however the further he goes, he realizes the world only gets darker and darker and that he has to face his deepest fears.
Fight your fears in boss battles, solve the world’s many puzzles, by combining many different mechanics and learn the truth of the world you are in.

On the surface, it looks like a classical story of saving your friend, but if you scratch a bit deeper, it becomes more complex, and more personal.              
The mechanics of the game are never a constant variable, they will always change and combine from level to level.    

The story is meant to be at the same time straightforward and abstract. Your goal is simple, save you friend. Who is that friend? Who are you? Why are you here? That's all up to you to figure it out, and we are sure everyone is going to have an idea of their own.
 It was made like this so you can be the writer of your own story.
Elin is the main character in this game. What is he? That's for you to decide.

Elin doesn't have superpowers, he can't run at the speed of light, he can't lift a truck. He is fueled by his emotions, and that's what gives him power.
Throughout the game, he uses his intelligence to manipulate objects around him and use them to his advantage, be it small rocks or strange contraptions left behind that manipulate gravity!
He has a guide, a light that pulled him into this world. It guides Elin throughout the game and gives him hope in the darkest of hours.

Oh, also... Sometimes he can fly.
